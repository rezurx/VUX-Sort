- Tagging/metadata for cards (to track categories across studies)  
- Drag-and-drop UI with accessibility support (keyboard, screen readers)  
- Custom card styling (colors, grouping labels)  

## 5. Analytics & Reporting
- Similarity matrix  
- Dendrograms (hierarchical clustering)  
- Agreement scores (per card, per category)  
- Heatmaps (which categories/cards are most common)

- Integration with usability suites (Maze, Optimal Workshop style)  
- Whiteboard synthesis mode (turn results into affinity diagramming)  
- Versioning (compare different study iterations)  

## 7. User Experience & Design
- Mobile-optimized sorting (touch-friendly)  
- Dark/light mode  
- Offline mode (results sync later)  
- Onboarding tutorials and templates (for beginners)

# Differentiation Ideas (Beyond Current Tools)
- **AI clustering**: After a sort, automatically generate suggested IA structures.  
- **Adaptive studies**: Cards/questions adapt based on participant behavior.  
- **Gamification**: Points/progress bar to keep participants engaged.  
- **Cross-method integration**: Link results with tree testing, usability testing, or surveys.  
- **Privacy & compliance**: HIPAA/GDPR-ready modes for sensitive domains (like healthcare).
