## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd "HFE Work/VUX-Sort"
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the displayed local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### Creating a Study

1. Click "Create Study" from the dashboard
2. Enter study name and description
3. Add cards by typing text and clicking "Add Card"
4. Add categories for participants to sort cards into
5. Configure study settings (participant limits, shuffling, etc.)
6. Save the study

### Running a Study

1. From the dashboard, click the "Start" button on a study
2. Share the participant interface with your participants
3. Participants drag cards into categories
4. Results are automatically saved upon completion

### Analyzing Results

1. Click "Analytics" on a study with collected data
2. View overview statistics (participant count, duration, etc.)
3. Explore the card similarity matrix to see grouping patterns
4. Analyze category usage frequency
5. Export results for further analysis

## Data Storage

The application uses browser localStorage to persist data. This means:
- Studies and results are saved locally in your browser
- No server setup required
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Clearing browser data will remove studies and results

For production use, consider integrating with a backend service for data persistence and sharing.
